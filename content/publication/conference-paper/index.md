title: "HTKG: Deep Keyphrase Generation with Neural Hierarchical Topic Guidance"
abstract: >
  Keyphrases can concisely describe the high-level topics discussed in a
  document that usually possesses hierarchical topic structures. Thus, it is
  crucial to understand the hierarchical topic structures and employ it to guide
  the keyphrase identification. However, integrating the hierarchical topic
  information into a deep keyphrase generation model is unexplored. In this
  paper, we focus on how to effectively exploit the hierarchical topic to
  improve the keyphrase generation performance (HTKG). Specifically, we propose
  a novel hierarchical topic-guided variational neural sequence generation
  method for keyphrase generation, which consists of two major modules: a neural
  hierarchical topic model that learns the latent topic tree across the whole
  corpus of documents, and a variational neural keyphrase generation model to
  generate keyphrases under hierarchical topic guidance. Finally, these two
  modules are jointly trained to help them learn complementary information from
  each other. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first attempt to
  leverage the neural hierarchical topic to guide keyphrase generation. The
  experimental results demonstrate that our method significantly outperforms the
  existing state-of-the-art methods across five benchmark datasets.

summary: 关键词生成是指从文本文档中自动生成反映该文档主题的几个词或短语，可广泛用于文本分类、话题检测、问答系统等许多具体应用领域，是自然语言处理领域的一个关键基础问题。针对关键词预测问题，课题组已取得一些研究成果，先后发表在2017年的第26届信息和知识管理国际学术会议CIKM（The
  26th ACM Conference on Information and Knowledge
  Management）、2019年的第57届计算语言学协会年会ACL（The 57th Annual Meeting of the Association
  for Computational
  Linguistics）、2018年的《软件学报》等上。其中2015级硕士研究生常耀成发表于《软件学报》2018年第7期的《特征驱动的关键词提取算法综述》一文入选《软件学报》2020年高影响力论文。
